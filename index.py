# Langauge
'''
Computer only understand Binary Code[0,1] which is also Called Low Level Languge.
So, to Communicate with Computer we use High Level Language like Python, Java, C++ etc. 

'''

# Python
'''
Python is Founded by Guido Wan Rosum.
Its Name Python Comes From "Monties Python Circus"
It is an Intepreated High Level Language.

'''

# Interpreated vs Compiler Language
'''
Interpreated Language Run the Code Line by Line
Compiler Language Run the Whole Code combined.

'''


# Learning Python
print("Hello World")

# Rules of Python 
'''
1. Characters that are Allowed = Nums, Alphabets, _
2. Dont Start with Numbers
3. Special Characters Should not be as a Python Variable

'''
# Naming Case
'''
Camel Case = atifHussain
Pascal Case = AtifHussain
Snake Case = atif_hussain

'''

# Variable
'''
a = 9
b = 7

// To Check Variable Type we use Type Function
Eg:- print(type(a))

'''

# Data Types
'''
a = "Atif Hussain" //String
b = 19             //Integer
c = 9.0            //Float
d = 12/3           //Float
e = True           //Boolean 
f = 12j + 1        //Complex

'''

# String
'''
Unicode of String:
   ord()
Unicode to Character:
   Char()

Indexing: 
a = "Atif Hussain"
print(a[1])
print(a[-1])

//String Slicing    ***ERROR***
developer = "Atif Hussain"
print(developer[0,4,1])

Type Conversion:
str()
int()
bool()
float()
complex()

'''
# developer = "Atif Hussain"   //Error
# print(developer[0,4,1])

# Input & Output
'''
print("Atif Hussain")

name = input("What is Your Name? ") //Default Sting Type

Fomrated Sting
print(f'My name is {name}')
'''

# Operators
'''
Arthimatic Operators
+ - / % // **

Assignment Operators
= 

Compound Assignments Operators
+= -+ /= %= //= ""=

Comparison Operators
> < >= <= == !=

Logical Operators
and or not

'''

# Conditional Statements
'''
    If
    elif
    else

'''

#Loops
'''
For Loop & While Loop

range(start point, end point + 1, steps) [used in for loop]

for i in range(1, 2, 3):
   print("Atif Hussain)

While Loop repats a Code until a Condition is True
while a == 1:
   print("HELLO WORLD")


'''

# Functions
'''
Functions is a Set of program that runs which preform that program when we call his name with paranthises

Eg: 
def hello():
   print("This ia a Hello Function)

hello()
